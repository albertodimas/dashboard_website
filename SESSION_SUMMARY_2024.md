# Session Summary - Multi-Staff Booking Module Implementation

## Date: December 24, 2024

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-staff booking module for businesses with multiple workers, allowing clients to book appointments with specific staff members.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Staff Management Module
- **Database Schema Updates**:
  - Added `enableStaffModule` boolean to Business model
  - Enhanced Staff model with photo, bio, rating, and totalReviews fields
  - Added `customerName` and `customerPhone` to Appointment model for per-appointment storage
  - Added ServiceStaff junction table for many-to-many relationships

### 2. Staff Module Toggle
- Created admin settings page to enable/disable staff module
- Added link in business owner dashboard to manage staff when module is enabled
- Module is optional and controlled per business

### 3. Staff Management Interface
- Full CRUD operations for staff members
- Assign staff to specific services
- Individual staff profiles with photo, bio, and specializations
- Staff assignment interface in service management

### 4. Booking Flow Enhancements
- **Staff Selection Step**: When a service has multiple staff assigned, customers can choose their preferred professional
- **Embedded Booking Form**: Booking form stays embedded in business landing page instead of redirecting
- **Dynamic Staff Loading**: Fixed API to handle customSlugs with slashes using catch-all routes
- **Individual Schedules**: Each staff member can have individual working hours while inheriting time intervals from business settings

### 5. Working Hours Management
- Individual schedule configuration per staff member
- Staff schedules inherit business time intervals (15, 30, 45, 60 minutes)
- Fallback to business-wide schedule if no staff-specific hours defined
- Proper availability checking based on selected staff

### 6. Appointment Display Improvements
- Show professional/staff name in appointments list when module is enabled
- Display staff information in appointment details
- Maintain customer name per appointment (not overwriting customer record)

### 7. Email & Confirmation Enhancements
- Include staff/professional name in confirmation emails
- Fixed date/time formatting in confirmation pages
- Updated confirmation messages to be more concise
- Fixed translation issues (using "Professional" consistently in English)

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. Prisma Client Synchronization
- **Issue**: Prisma client not recognizing new schema fields
- **Solution**: Killed Node processes, regenerated Prisma client with proper migrations

### 2. Staff Loading with Custom Slugs
- **Issue**: Invalid UUID error when using customSlug containing slashes
- **Solution**: Changed route from `[businessId]` to `[...businessId]` catch-all route, added UUID validation

### 3. Customer Name Persistence
- **Issue**: All appointments showing same customer name when booked with same email
- **Solution**: Store `customerName` and `customerPhone` directly in appointment record instead of updating customer

### 4. Translation Consistency
- **Issue**: Showing "Trabajador" in English confirmation emails
- **Solution**: Used hardcoded "Professional" label for English consistency

### 5. Port Conflicts
- **Issue**: Port 3000 occupied
- **Solution**: Server automatically switches to port 3001
